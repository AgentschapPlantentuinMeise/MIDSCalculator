This setup wizard will install an Rshiny app called MIDSCalculator intended for use on your local computer. The app facilitates calculating levels of the Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen standard (https://github.com/tdwg/mids) based on Occurrence datasets formatted according to the Darwin Core Archive standard.

This app requires R4.2.0. to work. If this is not already installed on your local system, the installer will install it as well. 

If an older version of R is installed, this app will install the newer version. Please note that this may modify the version of R third party applications such as Rstudio point to, including any packages installed.
